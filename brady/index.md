# The Brady Bunch Effect

## Focus

Students create parameterized character functions that will be combined into a collaborative grid display where all characters respond to the same inputs.

## Purpose

1. Practice all Create PT requirements through incremental development
2. Experience modular programming and collaboration
3. Build confidence in both programming and explaining code

## Progression

- Day 1: Character functions with parameters
- Day 2: Add input responsiveness
- Day 3: Use lists for variations
- Day 4: Implement algorithms with selection/iteration
- Day 5: Integrate into the Brady Bunch grid

## Definition of Done

## Consolidation

A single sketch containing a grid of all student-created characters that simultaneously respond to user input (like moving eyeballs that follow the mouse).
